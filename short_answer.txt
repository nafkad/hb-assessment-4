1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
The difference between a client and a server is that the former is known as the front-end part to our application,
while the latter is known as the back-end part of the application.
The client is the one that sends the request, while the server is the one that responds to the client's request.


-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server? - change wording
A "route" on a server is refers to a predetermined path or endpint on the server that is associated with a specific 
resource functionality. 
It defines how the server should respond when a client--usually a web browser--makes a request to a particular URL.


-------------------
3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

Order of events from start to finish:
1. - The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
2. - The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
3. - The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
4. - The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
5. - The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
